# node-dynect

**Development is currently in progress, and library is non-functional.**

A client library for interacting with the Dynect Managed DNS API.

This library will be modelled after
[@pksunkara](https://github.com/pksunkara)'s excellent
[`octonode`](https://github.com/pksunkara/octonode#readme) library.
